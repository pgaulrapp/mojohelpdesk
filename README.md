# mojohelpdesk
This script gets a count of all open tickets in a specific queue in Mojo Helpdesk. I wrote it to give myself an overview of ticket counts each day.

For the setup, you will need:

• Google API access turned on

• A service account activated

• The queue ID from Mojo (This can be found in the URL of any Mojo search that specifies a queue)

• Your API access key from Mojo (This can be found on the profile page in Mojo)

• Your Mojo subdomain (exampledomain.mojohelpdesk.com, only the exampledomain part unless you want to change the script)
